pillow

vast landscape

provider of comfort

crevices

mountains

hills and valley

featherers within

soft and plushy

easy to stain

large and small

stitches and patches

sharp peaks at the four corners

bend and conform to my comfort

wars fought with them

where loves talk eye to eye

place for my head to rest

srunch and fluff

creases

the warm breath of a lover

the drifting off into sleep

covered in a dress

servants to our needs

diplomats to our vulnerable conversation

mcs, mediators

factory sewn

hand sewn

biting

kissing sobbing into the pillow

an abyss for perfectly kept secrets

forever listener to our snores

airplane companions

shape shifters

world wide tradition

the keepers of our bed

a landscape of stitched hexagons
