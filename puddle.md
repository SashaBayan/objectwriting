puddle

splashing

walden pond

solitude

dirty

birds take their drink

ants nourish their bodies

a deep lake for the insects

shoes splaishing

micro tsuanmis

thin glass on concrete

shallow and still

ringlets growing from the center

drying up in the sun

brought back by the rain

cars driving through tit

kids playing

ponchos

rain coats

rubber suits to keep the rain away

lonely puddle when the rain shops

mirror to the sky above

shallow

the sun bakes away the puddle

puddle to puddle, cousin to cousin

wet

splashed on me

left me cold and in need of a shower

filled by a faucet from the sky

proffer the cup from the murky water
